# - What is React and how does it work?

🔹 What is React?

Component-based: Everything in React is a component (a button, form, navbar, etc.). Components can be reused and composed together.

Declarative: You describe what you want to see in the UI, and React takes care of updating the DOM efficiently.

Virtual DOM: React uses an in-memory representation of the DOM (Virtual DOM) to figure out the minimal changes needed and updates only those parts in the real DOM.

🔹 How does React work?

    1. Write Components

    - You define UI pieces as components (functions or classes).

    2. Render with JSX

    - React uses JSX (JavaScript XML), a syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.

    3. Virtual DOM Creation

    - When you render components, React builds a lightweight copy of the DOM (the Virtual DOM).

    4. Diffing Algorithm

    - When state/props change:

        - React compares the new Virtual DOM with the old one (a process called reconciliation).

        - It finds the minimal differences (diff).

    5. Efficient DOM Update

    - React updates only the changed parts in the real DOM instead of re-rendering the entire UI. This makes it fast and efficient.

    6. Unidirectional Data Flow

    - Data flows in one direction:

        - Parent → Child using props.

        - State is usually managed inside components and can be lifted up if needed.

# - Functional vs Class components

| **Aspect**      | **Functional Components** ✅ _(Modern & Preferred)_                                | **Class Components** 🟡 _(Older Approach)_                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**  | JavaScript functions that return JSX.                                              | ES6 classes that extend `React.Component`.                          |
| **Hooks**       | Use **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.) to manage state and lifecycle. | Use `this.state` and lifecycle methods (`componentDidMount`, etc.). |
| **Simplicity**  | Shorter, easier, and more readable.                                                | Verbose and harder to manage.                                       |
| **Performance** | More optimized because of hooks and no need to bind `this`.                        | Slightly slower due to `this` binding and lifecycle overhead.       |
| **Recommended** | ✅ Yes, preferred in modern React (16.8+).                                         | ❌ Mostly replaced by functional components.                        |

- Lifecycle Methods vs Hooks

| **Feature** | **Class Component**                 | **Functional Component**                  |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Mounting    | `componentDidMount`                 | `useEffect(() => {}, [])`                 |
| Updating    | `componentDidUpdate`                | `useEffect(() => {}, [dep])`              |
| Unmounting  | `componentWillUnmount`              | `useEffect(() => { return cleanup }, [])` |
| State       | `this.state` + `this.setState()`    | `useState()`                              |
| Context     | `contextType` or `Context.Consumer` | `useContext()`                            |
| Refs        | `React.createRef()`                 | `useRef()`                                |

=> When to Use Functional vs Class -

✅ Use Functional Components when:

        - You're using React 16.8+ (modern apps).

        - You want cleaner, shorter, and more readable code.

        - You want to use hooks for state and lifecycle.

🟡 Use Class Components when:

        - You're working on legacy React projects.

        - The project already heavily uses class-based architecture.

Q: Why did React move from class components to functional components?

    - Hooks allow stateful logic inside functions.

    - Functional components are simpler, shorter, and easier to test.

    - No need for this keyword.

    - Better performance due to React's Concurrent Mode optimizations.

# - Props vs State

| **Aspect**       | **Props** ✅                                          | **State** 🟢                                            |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**   | Data **passed from parent** to child.                 | Data **managed inside the component**.                  |
| **Mutability**   | **Immutable** → Cannot be changed.                    | **Mutable** → Can be updated using hooks or `setState`. |
| **Who Controls** | **Parent component** controls props.                  | **Component itself** controls state.                    |
| **Usage**        | To pass **data & configuration** to child components. | To handle **dynamic data & UI changes**.                |
| **Update**       | Updated **by parent**.                                | Updated **by the component itself**.                    |
| **Reusability**  | Makes components **reusable**.                        | State is **local** to the component.                    |
| **Example**      | `<User name="Ashutosh" />`                            | `const [count, setCount] = useState(0)`                 |

Q: Can a child modify props?
A: ❌ No, props are read-only. If needed, the parent must pass a callback to update data.

Q: Does updating props trigger re-render?
A: ✅ Yes, when props change, React re-renders the child component.

Q: Can we pass state as props?
A: ✅ Yes, you can pass state variables from parent to child as props.

Q: Which causes a re-render — props or state?
A: Both. Whenever props or state change, React re-renders the component.

# - JSX and its purpose

- JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
  It’s a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows us to write HTML-like code inside React components.

- JSX is not understood by browsers directly.
  It is compiled into JavaScript using Babel before execution.

Q: What is JSX in React?
A: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows writing HTML-like code inside React components. It gets compiled to React.createElement() calls.

Q: Is JSX mandatory in React?
A: ❌ No, but it makes code simpler and more readable.

Q: How is JSX different from HTML?
A: JSX looks like HTML but is actually JavaScript and supports dynamic rendering using {}.

Q: Who converts JSX into JavaScript?
A: Babel transpiles JSX into React.createElement() calls.

# - Virtual DOM

- Virtual DOM is an in-memory copy of the real DOM that React uses to detect changes and update only the necessary parts of the UI.

Q: Why React Uses Virtual DOM?
A:

=> Manipulating the Real DOM is slow because:

        - Every DOM update causes reflows and repaints.

        - Large apps with many elements would become laggy.

=> React solves this by:

        - Keeping a virtual copy of the UI in memory.

        - Calculating differences between the old and new Virtual DOM.

        - Updating only the changed parts in the Real DOM.

=> Example -

```
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

How React Handles It Internally:

1. Creates a new Virtual DOM when count changes.

2. Compares it with the previous Virtual DOM.

3. Finds only <h2> changed.

4. Updates just that part in the Real DOM.

=> React’s Diffing & Reconciliation

    - React uses a highly optimized algorithm:

        => Diffing Algorithm

            - Compares old and new Virtual DOM trees.

            - If an element is different, React marks it for an update.

            - Uses O(n) complexity → very efficient.

        => Reconciliation

            - Applies only the necessary changes to the Real DOM.

Q: What is the Virtual DOM?
A: It's a lightweight copy of the real DOM that React uses to efficiently update the UI.

Q: How does Virtual DOM improve performance?
A: React compares the new Virtual DOM with the old one (diffing) and updates only the changed parts in the Real DOM.

Q: What is reconciliation?
A: The process of updating the Real DOM based on differences between old and new Virtual DOM.

Q: Is the Virtual DOM faster than the Real DOM?
A: Yes, because it minimizes expensive DOM operations.

# - Event handling

- Event handling in React means responding to user actions like clicks, typing, form submissions, mouse movements, key presses, etc.

| **Aspect**              | **React Synthetic Event** ✅                      | **Native Event** 🟡                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**          | React’s wrapper around native events.             | Browser’s built-in DOM events.                  |
| **Performance**         | Uses **event delegation** for better performance. | Handlers are attached directly to each element. |
| **Cross-browser**       | ✅ Same behavior across browsers.                 | ❌ May behave differently in browsers.          |
| **Access Native Event** | `event.nativeEvent`                               | Directly available.                             |

=> Event Delegation in React:

    - React uses event delegation for performance:

        - Instead of attaching listeners to each element, React attaches a single listener to the root DOM node.

        - React then uses event bubbling to detect which component triggered the event.

        - This reduces memory usage and improves speed.

=> Best Practices

✅ Use arrow functions for automatic this binding.
✅ Use meaningful handler names (handleClick, handleChange, handleSubmit).
✅ Use e.preventDefault() for form submissions.
✅ Use e.stopPropagation() when needed to prevent event bubbling.
✅ Keep event handlers small and clean.

Q: How is event handling in React different from HTML?
A:

Uses camelCase (onClick vs onclick).

Passes functions, not strings.

Uses Synthetic Events for cross-browser support.

Q: What is a Synthetic Event in React?
A:
A wrapper around native events that normalizes behavior across browsers.

Q: How to pass parameters to event handlers?
A:
Use an arrow function:

```
onClick={() => handleClick(id)}
```

Q: How does React handle events internally?
A:
Through event delegation on the root element.

# - Key prop in lists (React keys and why they’re important)

- In React, a key is a special attribute you provide when rendering lists of elements.

- It helps React identify which items have changed, added, or removed.

- Definition: A unique identifier for each item in a list so React can efficiently update the DOM.

=> Why Keys Are Important?

- React uses the Virtual DOM and updates the Real DOM using a diffing algorithm.
  When you render a list, React compares the new Virtual DOM with the old one to decide what changed.

        - Without keys → React re-renders all items unnecessarily.

        - With keys → React updates only the changed items → faster performance.

Q: Why are keys used in React lists?
A: Keys help React identify which elements have changed, allowing efficient updates.

Q: What happens if you don’t use keys?
A: React re-renders all list items, which impacts performance and can cause bugs.

Q: Can we use array index as a key?
A: Use only when the list is static and won’t change. Otherwise, prefer unique IDs.

Q: How do keys improve performance?
A: React uses diffing; keys allow it to skip unchanged items and update only the modified ones.

Best Practices

✅ Always use unique IDs for keys.

✅ Avoid using indexes unless the list is static.

✅ Keep keys stable — they shouldn’t change between renders.

✅ Use consistent keys when rendering dynamic components.

# - Default props

- In React, default props allow you to set default values for props when they are not passed by the parent component.

- This ensures that your component always has a value to work with and avoids undefined errors.

| **Use Case**     | **Without Default Props ❌**        | **With Default Props ✅**   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Missing prop     | `undefined` errors                  | Always has a value          |
| Code readability | Hard to know default behavior       | Self-documented             |
| Better DX        | Need to handle `undefined` manually | React handles automatically |
| Avoid bugs       | Random crashes possible             | Safer components            |

# - React Hooks:

        - What are hooks?

        - useState

        - useEffect

        - useMemo

        - useCallback

        - useRef

1. React Hooks are special functions introduced in React 16.8 that allow you to use state, lifecycle methods, and other React features in functional components without writing class components.

- Before Hooks

  - State and lifecycle methods were only available in class components.

  - Functional components were stateless.

- After Hooks

  - Functional components became powerful and stateful.

  - Hooks provide a cleaner, more reusable, and more readable way to write components.

2. useState 🟢
   Purpose → To manage state in a functional component.

```
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
```

- state → Current state value.

- setState → Function to update the state.

- initialValue → Initial value of the state.

Key Points

- Re-rendering: When you call setCount, React re-renders the component.

- State batching: Multiple state updates inside the same event are batched for performance.

3. useEffect 🔄
   Purpose → To handle side effects in functional components.

A side effect is anything that affects something outside the component, such as:

- API calls

- DOM manipulation

- Setting timers

- Subscribing/unsubscribing to events

=> useEffect uses :

    - No dependency array → runs every time the component re-renders.

    - Empty dependency array → runs only once when the component mounts.

    - Runs only when count changes. (condition where the dependency array has some state or variable or something)

    - Useful for removing subscriptions, event listeners, or timers.
    Example =>

```
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setInterval(() => {
    console.log("Running...");
  }, 1000);

  return () => {
    clearInterval(timer);
    console.log("Cleanup done");
  };
}, []);
```

4. useMemo 🧠
   Purpose → To optimize performance by memoizing expensive calculations.

```
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeSomething(a, b), [a, b]);
```

- useMemo caches the result of the function.

- It recalculates only when dependencies change.

5. useCallback 🔗
   Purpose → To memoize functions and prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components.

```
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  doSomething(a, b);
}, [a, b]);
```

6. useRef 📌

   Purpose →

   - To reference DOM elements.

   - To store mutable values without triggering re-renders.

   - To cache previous values.

# - Controlled vs Uncontrolled components

1. Controlled Components ✅

Definition

    - A controlled component is a form input whose value is controlled by React state.

    - The source of truth → React state.

    - Every time you type, React updates the state.

    - The input value comes from state → React is in full control.

```
import React, { useState } from "react";

function ControlledForm() {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({ name: "", email: "" });

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setFormData({ ...formData, [e.target.name]: e.target.value });
  };

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log("Form submitted:", formData);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <h2>Controlled Form</h2>
      <input
        name="name"
        value={formData.name}
        onChange={handleChange}
        placeholder="Enter your name"
      />
      <input
        name="email"
        value={formData.email}
        onChange={handleChange}
        placeholder="Enter your email"
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default ControlledForm;

```

How it works :-

    1. User types in the input.

    2. onChange updates the React state.

    3. React re-renders the component.

    4. The value of the input always matches the state.

2. Uncontrolled Components ⚠️

Definition

    - An uncontrolled component is a form input whose value is controlled by the DOM, not React.

    - The source of truth → DOM itself.

    - You don’t store the value in React state.

    - You access the value using useRef or document.querySelector().

```
import React, { useRef } from "react";

function UncontrolledForm() {
  const nameRef = useRef();
  const emailRef = useRef();

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log({
      name: nameRef.current.value,
      email: emailRef.current.value,
    });
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <h2>Uncontrolled Form</h2>
      <input ref={nameRef} placeholder="Enter name" />
      <input ref={emailRef} placeholder="Enter email" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default UncontrolledForm;
```

| **Feature**           | **Controlled Component** ✅          | **Uncontrolled Component** ⚠️                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Source of Truth**   | React State                          | DOM                                                    |
| **Access Value**      | From state (`value`)                 | Using `ref` or DOM APIs                                |
| **onChange Handling** | Required                             | Optional                                               |
| **Validation**        | Easy                                 | Harder                                                 |
| **Resetting Inputs**  | Easy (`setState("")`)                | Manual (`ref.current.value`)                           |
| **Performance**       | Slightly slower for very large forms | Faster for very simple forms                           |
| **Use Cases**         | Recommended for most apps            | Useful for simple, legacy, or third-party integrations |

Q: What’s the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React?
A:

- Controlled components → React state is the single source of truth.

- Uncontrolled components → The DOM manages the input value internally, and you fetch it using ref.

- Controlled components are preferred because they make form handling, validation, and state management easier.

# - React Router & client-side routing

- React Router is the most popular library for handling routing in React single-page applications (SPA). It enables client-side routing, meaning page transitions happen without refreshing the browser.

A. What is Client-Side Routing? 🧠

- Normally, in server-side routing:

  1. Each time you click a link → Browser sends a request to the server.

  2. The server responds with a new HTML page → Full page reload.

- In client-side routing (React Router):

  1. The app loads once.

  2. React Router intercepts link clicks.

  3. It updates the URL but doesn’t reload the page.

  4. The right component is rendered dynamically.

=> React Router Best Practices

✅ Use Link instead of <a> → prevents full reloads
✅ Use useNavigate instead of window.location.href
✅ Use Outlet for nested routing
✅ Use Suspense & React.lazy() for code-splitting

Q1. Difference between client-side and server-side routing?

    - Client-side: Faster, SPA-based, React Router manages views.

    - Server-side: Full page reloads, server serves new HTML every time.

Q2. How does React Router work internally?

    - Uses the History API (pushState, replaceState)

    - Listens to URL changes → renders matching component.

# - Context API vs Redux (when to use one over the other)

| Feature             | **Context API** 🟢                         | **Redux** 🔴                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Library Type**    | Built-in React API                         | External library                                 |
| **Best For**        | Small to medium apps                       | Large, complex apps                              |
| **State Structure** | Simple                                     | Organized & centralized                          |
| **Performance**     | Rerenders all consumers when value changes | Optimized with selective updates                 |
| **Debugging**       | Limited                                    | Powerful dev tools                               |
| **Boilerplate**     | Minimal                                    | More setup required                              |
| **Async Support**   | Manual                                     | Built-in support with **Redux Thunk** / **Saga** |

=> When to Use Which?

✅ Use Context API → Small to medium apps, light global state, simple logic

✅ Use Redux → Large-scale apps, multiple data sources, complex updates, debugging needs

# - Prop drilling & solutions

- Prop drilling happens when you pass data from a parent component to a deeply nested child component through multiple intermediate components, even if those components don’t need the data.

- This leads to:

  - Unnecessary code complexity

  - More boilerplate

  - Performance issues due to unwanted re-renders

=> When to Use Which Solution

| **Scenario**                 | **Best Solution**         | **Why**                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Small app, few global states | **Context API**           | Simple & built-in                   |
| Medium app, moderate state   | **Context + useReducer**  | Better control & cleaner updates    |
| Large app, complex state     | **Redux Toolkit**         | Centralized store & debugging tools |
| Heavy API usage              | **React Query / Zustand** | Better server-state management      |

# - React.memo for optimization

- React.memo is a higher-order component (HOC) in React that optimizes performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders of functional components.

- By default, React re-renders a component whenever its parent re-renders, even if props haven't changed.

- React.memo caches the rendered result (memoization) and reuses it if props are the same.

Q1. What is React.memo and when would you use it?

React.memo is a higher-order component that memoizes functional components and skips re-renders if props haven't changed.

Use it for performance optimization when:

    - Props rarely change

    - Component is expensive to re-render

Q2. Why doesn’t React.memo work with objects or functions?

Because objects and functions are compared by reference, not value.
Use useMemo or useCallback to stabilize references.

=> Difference between React.memo and useMemo?

| Feature | **React.memo**                   | **useMemo**                 |

# - Higher-Order Components (HOCs)

- An HOC is a function that takes a component as input and returns a new component with enhanced features.

- Key Points :-

  - HOC adds extra functionality to components without modifying their code.

  - HOCs reuse logic across multiple components.

  - Mostly used in authentication, logging, data fetching, analytics, and permissions.

- Example of HOCs

```
function withAuth(WrappedComponent) {
  return function AuthHOC(props) {
    const isAuthenticated = localStorage.getItem("token");

    if (!isAuthenticated) {
      return <h3>Access Denied. Please Login.</h3>;
    }

    return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
  };
}

const Dashboard = () => <h1>Dashboard</h1>;
export default withAuth(Dashboard);
```

HOCs vs Custom Hooks ⚡

- Custom Hooks have replaced HOCs in modern React.

| Feature     | **HOCs**                             | **Custom Hooks**          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Code Reuse  | ✅ Yes                               | ✅ Yes                    |
| Readability | ❌ Nested HOCs can be confusing      | ✅ Much cleaner           |
| Performance | Slightly slower due to extra renders | More efficient            |
| Popularity  | Used in older codebases              | Preferred in modern React |

# - Re-renders & performance optimization (memoization, lazy loading, code splitting)

Q: What Causes Re-renders in React

A: React components re-render when:

    - State changes (useState)

    - Props change (parent passes new props)

    - Context value changes (useContext)

    - Parent re-renders (child also re-renders, even if props didn't change)

    - Force updates (forceUpdate, Redux, etc.)

=> Lazy Loading in React

- Lazy loading means loading components only when needed instead of loading everything at once.

- This improves initial load performance.

=> Best Practices for Performance Optimization

| **Technique**               | **Use Case**                                             |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **React.memo**              | Prevent child re-renders when props don’t change         |
| **useMemo**                 | Cache expensive computations                             |
| **useCallback**             | Prevent function recreation & child re-renders           |
| **Lazy loading**            | Load components only when needed                         |
| **Code splitting**          | Reduce initial bundle size                               |
| **Debouncing & Throttling** | Optimize API calls & heavy events                        |
| **Virtualization**          | Use `react-window` or `react-virtualized` for long lists |
| **React Profiler**          | Detect performance bottlenecks                           |

# - Error boundaries (what they are & how to implement)

- An Error Boundary is a special React component that catches JavaScript errors in child components during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors, without crashing the entire app.

- What Error Boundaries Catch & Don’t Catch ⚠️

| **Caught** ✅                              | **Not Caught** ❌                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Rendering errors in child components       | **Event handlers**                            |
| Errors in lifecycle methods                | **Asynchronous code** (`setTimeout`, `fetch`) |
| Errors in constructors of child components | Errors inside **error boundary itself**       |

# - React Fiber

- React Fiber is the reconciliation engine introduced in React 16. It is basically a complete re-implementation of React's core reconciliation algorithm.

- Key Concepts of React Fiber:

  - Fiber Node:

    - The fundamental unit of work in React Fiber. Each React element in the component tree corresponds to a Fiber node. These nodes are linked together to form a Fiber tree, which mirrors the structure of the component tree.

  - Incremental Rendering:

    - Fiber enables React to break down the rendering work into smaller, manageable chunks (fibers) and spread them out over multiple frames. This allows React to pause and resume work, preventing the UI from freezing during heavy updates.

  - Prioritization:

    - Fiber introduces a system for prioritizing updates. Urgent tasks, such as user interactions or animations, can be given higher priority than less critical tasks, like background data fetching, ensuring a smoother user experience.

  - Concurrency:

    - Fiber's architecture lays the groundwork for concurrent mode, a feature that allows React to handle multiple updates simultaneously without blocking the main thread. This is achieved through time-slicing, where React allocates small chunks of time to different tasks, ensuring responsiveness.

  - Reconciliation:

    - Fiber re-implements the reconciliation process, which is how React determines the differences between the old and new virtual DOM trees and updates the actual DOM. Fiber's approach allows for more efficient and flexible updates compared to the previous stack-based reconciler.

# - Concurrent Mode

- React Concurrent Mode, introduced in React 18, is a set of features and an underlying mechanism that enables React to prepare multiple versions of the UI simultaneously and prioritize updates, leading to a more responsive and fluid user experience.

- Key Concepts:

  - Time-Slicing and Interruptible Rendering:

    - Unlike traditional synchronous rendering where React completes one update before starting another, Concurrent Mode allows React to pause and resume rendering work. This "time-slicing" enables React to interrupt a lower-priority rendering task to handle a higher-priority one (like user input or animations) and then return to the original task later.

  - Prioritization:

    - Concurrent Mode introduces the concept of prioritizing updates. React can distinguish between urgent updates (e.g., direct user interaction) and less urgent ones (e.g., background data fetching) and prioritize accordingly.

  - Transitions:

    - A specific feature enabled by Concurrent Mode, transitions allow you to mark certain updates as "non-urgent." This tells React that if a more urgent update comes in while the transition is rendering, it can be interrupted. This is particularly useful for smooth UI changes during data fetching or complex state updates, preventing jank.

  - Suspense:

    - While not exclusively tied to Concurrent Mode, Suspense for data fetching leverages the concurrent rendering capabilities to display fallback UI (like loading indicators) while data is being fetched, preventing the entire UI from blocking.

# - Hydration in React (SSR/Next.js context, but concept applies to React too)

1. What is Hydration in React? 🧵

Hydration is the process where React takes a static HTML page (rendered on the server) and attaches event listeners + makes it interactive on the client.

It happens after Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG).

- Basic Flow

1. Server generates HTML → HTML is sent to the browser.

2. Browser displays static HTML instantly → good for SEO & performance.

3. React runs on the client → loads JavaScript, attaches event handlers, and activates components.

4. Now the page is fully interactive.

This process of “attaching interactivity” = hydration.
